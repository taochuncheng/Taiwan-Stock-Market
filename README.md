Python3 Codes to compile data from TWSE, aiming to gather and store data for investors in Taiwan

The scripts are to be freely used by anyone who is interested in gathering data from TWSE, or simple wants to get a grasp of the Taiwan stock market as the data will not be super comprehensive but I will try to grab as much as there is to the public. 

Disclaimer: All data grabbed are openly available information from Taiwan Stock Exchange or its affiliates with no intention to predict or form investment decisions of any sort. Investments profits and losses based on the data provided shall not be legally responsible by the provider of the codes.
